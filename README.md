*** READ ME! IRRLICHT_WALKING_PERSON ***
Author: Tracy Lynn Wesley

This is a program created with the Irrlicht 3D Engine.

The model in this example was created by joseph girty.

The map in this example is a Quake3 map that came with the Irrlicht engine.

This program was created for practicing purposes, in order for me to familiarize myself with graphics/game engines (irrlicht is somewhat a mix of the two).

I have provided an executable file so anybody can preview the program. (Look in the releases folder)

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
-Use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to move your character and use the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to rotate.
-Use the +/- buttons to zoom the camera in and out, or press c to change the camera style (first person vs. third person)
-press SPACEBAR to jump.
-Hold the R button to run.

Have fun!

NOTE: I HAVE SO FAR BEEN UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS MODEL WILL NOT LOAD A TEXTURE IN IRRLICHT. OTHER MODELS LOADED TEXTURES SUCCESSFULLY.
NOTE: IN ORDER TO COMPILE FROM SOURCE, YOU MUST HAVE DOWNLOADED THE IRRLICHT 3D ENGINE AND ALL DEPENDENCIES.
